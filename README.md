# gf-hubspot-addon
This plugin works as an add-on for Gravity Forms allowing you to submit any Gravity Form to a duplicate form in Hubspot to automatically sync your submissions.

NOTE: It is highly recommended that you also have either the official Hubspot WP plugin installed or at least have the Hubspot tracking code installed on your site as well. This will ensure that all of the Hubspot tracking data gets sent over with each submission.
